# Assyst - The dev-facilitating bot
Assyst's primary purpose is to provide ease-of-life features to developers.
It has a range of utilitarian commands, ranging from code execution to website screenshotting.

## Features
    - Powerful message edit and delete handling, so command messages can be edited and the command will be re-run.
    - Completely open-source. Anyone can contribute.
    - Simple to self-host, extend, and modify.
    - Powerful flag parsing and documentation of all flags.
    - Written in pure TypeScript, with as little dependency on libraries as possible.
    - Customisable prefix, with mention support.
